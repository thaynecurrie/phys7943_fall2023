    "### What is AstroPy [and AstroQuery]?\n",
    "\n",
    "_**Astropy**_ is a collection of open-source Python software packages for astronomy.  The Wikipedia page gives one version of its history and reason for development.   My personal read is that it was developed for a couple of reasons.  First, that Python as a programming language was catching on in the scientific community, esp in astronomy, and in data science: #1 language for data science now.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, that there were shortcomings with existing ecosystems for reducing and analyzing astronomical data.  A lot of people just didn't like IRAF at all (nor should they: it's awful).   While (my beloved) IDL is a nice language with a huge astronomy library based out of NASA-Goddard and wide usage, 1) its core programming is closed source, 2) it isn't widely used outside of the military or astronomy, planetary science, and adjacent fields, and 3) licensing costs for IDL restricted access can be rough: not everyone has 100-3000 dollars lying around.  Also, Python -- when properly optimized -- can be both _really_ fast and user friendly.  Hence, the need to develop a Python-based astronomy ecosystem to replace these capabilities.   Hence, AstroPy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being this core astro ecosystem, AstroPy is usually called in a bunch of other packages that are widely used in astronomy or paired with other existing packages to do different stuff.   A common astronomy-specific package is _**astroquery**_ which, you guessed it, queries all sorts of stuff from databases online.\n",

    "Our discussion will cover both of these packages.  \n",

You can do ``from astropy import *`` to import EVERYTHING but this is not a good idea (it takes too long; other reasons, etc.).  Better to name the specific packages you want to open.   I.e. the proper syntax is ``from astropy import [nameofsubpackage]``.   Sometimes it is also easier to rename the subpackages to something shorthand to save time typing.\n",

    "Everyone in astronomy talks uses \"FITS\" files, which stands for \"Flexible Image Transport System\" (see this entry in the Library of Congress [https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000317.shtml]() ).  Basically, when we go to a telescope and take data, the standard in all of astronomy is that those data are stored in the FITS format.  Basically everywhere and always now.  FITS originated in the 1980s when people used FORTRAN to write code that saves data: hence it has some minor quirks that make FORTRAN happy but that are irrelevant for data science-friendly languages you will use like Python (yada yada, no unsigned integers in FORTRAN).    Some astronomers have thought about replacing FITS with \"something\" ... but apparently no one likes the alternatives.  And like the early vs late-type nomenclature stars, astronomers are resistant to some changes, so we are probably stuck with FITS for good (which is fine: FITS is great!).  \n",
    "\n",
    "First, you have to import the relevant libraries.  In AstroPy, this will always be `` from astropy.io import fits``\n",

If you want to also _display_ your image, matplotlib is what you want: ``import matplotlib.pyplot as plt``.

    "\n",
    "The first thing to do with a fits file -- again, a file that stores astronomical **_data_** -- is to read it in.   FORTRAN and C do this in a slightly wonky way that seg-faults easily if you don't say the exact magic words.

First, as the commented-out code block notes, ``hdu.info()`` prints information about then umber of extensions of the fits file, the name of each extension, the type, the length of the header (stored as _card_), the dimensions of the data, and the format of the data.  For this particular file, there is only the primary HDU (index of 0), the header is 268 elements long, the data is a 512x512 array, and the data format is float32 (i.e. double precision).  \n",

    "Third, ``image_header=hdu[0].header`` saves the header for this FITS file as the variable _header_.   What are the contents of _image\\_header_?  Well, first you can figure out its length -- ``len(image_header)`` -- which returns 268 (same value as the _card_).   You can print out different elements of the header.  ``image_header`` prints out the entire header, while ``image_header[0:10]`` prints out the first 10 elements of header:\n",

    " What next?  Let's display the image with **matplotlib**.   The key command to do this is ``._imshow``, which is tied to either plt or axes (e.g. ``axes.imshow(image,[bunchofkeywords])``).   Let's use the latter since -- as we saw before -- it allows more flexibility.  \n",
    " \n",
    " Some important keywords for _imshow_ include: \n",
    " \n",
    " * origin - set this to 'lower' to maintain the image[0,0] point at the lower left.  Otherwise matplotlib flips the image upside-down compared to other standard image display programs like DS9.\n",

    " \n",
    " * clim - a tuple.  what are the min and max values to display?\n",
    " \n",
    " Preliminary steps to show an image from ``axes.imshow`` are as before: e.g. ``fig,axes = plt.subplots([keywords])`` and variables (if needed) to set the limits and color maps.  \n",
    " \n",
    " Now, you can customize further, by setting the region of the image to display from _set\\_[x,y]lim_ .   For example, if you want to center the image display upon some coordinates -- center[0] and center[1] -- in y and x with some window size of value _windowsize_ from the displayed image center, then you should set ``axes.set_ylim(center[0]-windowsize,center[0]+windowsize)`` and ``axes.set_xlim(center[1]-windowsize,center[1]+windowsize)``.  \n",

And calling _hdu.info()_ shows that FITS file had just a primary header.   But if you ever look at actual data from many telescopes/instruments (e.g. HST), you will see FITS images with _many_ extensions.  E.g. HST data has at least 3 data extensions -- the data, error estimate, and data quality flag.  So we need to read in data and headers from multiple different extensions.\n",

    "\n",
    "You can read in primary header by ``hdu[0].header``: e.g. ``primary_header=hdu[0].header``.  The first extension header is then e.g. ``ext_header=hdu[1].header``.   Reading in data from the primary HDU will trigger an error (because there are *no* data assigned to this HDU).   The data lie in the first extension:\n",

    "\n",
    "Right ascension and declination are examples of the World Coordinate System (WCS).  So the first step is to import the Python function that deals with WCS: ``from astropy.wcs import WCS`` .  We need to map WCS onto the pixel coordinates using information in the FITS header.  If you have a valid FITS header, you can then _project_ the WCS coordinate system onto your image.   A simple way to do this is in the _fig,axes= plt.subplots()_ call: ``fig,axes=plt.subplots(subplot_kw={'projection':wcs})``.   Then the x and y coordinates displayed will be RA and DEC.

    "  ### RGB Images, Data Cubes, and Animations\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Astronomical images are obtained in different passbands, whereas the human retina has red, green, and blue-sensing cones to render the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum into stereo color.   For astronomy, we can mimick this somewhat with _RGB_ composite images.   Combining AstroPy with Matplotlib allows us to create nice composite RGB images from three separate FITS files.   \n",
    "  \n",
    "  The key trick to making this work is with the _imshow_ call.  Instead of e.g. ``axes.imshow(image,*kwargs)`` where image is a simple 2-D array, we call ``axes.imshow(image_cube,*kwargs)`` where image_cube has dimensions of x,y,3: i.e. it is a data cube consisting of three separate image arrays where red, green, and blue are _image\\_cube[:,:,0]_ , _image\\_cube[:,:,1]_ , and _image\\_cube[:,:,2]_ , respectively.  If you load this type of array into _imshow_, matplotlib automatically thinks you are trying to do an RGB composite image.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  However, the display scaling is slightly tricky.  With no adjustments, you may get this notification: ``Clipping input data to the valid range for imshow with RGB data ([0..1] for floats or [0..255] for integers).``.    That is, if your array consists of floating-point data (it will), matplotlib will clip out all pixel values lying outside of the range 0 to 1.   \n",
    "  \n",
    "  Therefore, you will need to normalize each image going into an RGB image.  E.g.  if you want to do an RGB image of a galaxy and bright regions of the galaxy in the R,G, and B images have a characteristic value of 3500, 3000, and 2000 counts then you will need to divide your images by 3500, 3000, and 2000,respectively.  Values larger than this will be set to 1 (i.e. the maximum color).   Values less than 0 will be clipped out and will appear completely black.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Below is an example of an RGB image of the star HIP 99770 drawn from Subaru Telescope data at J (1.25 microns), H (1.65 microns), and Ks (2.16 microns), showing the detection of the exoplanet HIP 99770 b, which appears white-ish red (since I have normalized the J, H, and K images to characteristic peak values for the planet and the planet is intrinsically red).\n",
    "  \n",
    "  I have also added some minor markups, remapping the image x and y coordinates into an offset from the star's center by the _extent_ parameter in _imshow_ , adding a \"hanning\" pixel interpolation, and and adding a star symbol to denote the star's position.\n",

The comments note how to do this using FFMpegWriter to produce an mp4 file.  **CAUTION** using FFMpegWriter can get very tricky, though, as it is prone to throwing errors, especially on older laptops.  The fool-proof way to get this to work is to download a precompiled ffmpeg driver appropriate for your OS and add its location to your \\$PATH variable.   Here are several ways of getting this to work on a Mac OS:\n",

    "Two other custom things that we did.  First, created our own color map.   We started with the \"gist_heat\" map (black to red to white), did a bunch of transposing and ended up with a colormap that goes from blue to white, which looks identical to the SAOimage/DS9 \"cool\" colormap, which is often used in exoplanet imaging.  Second, we set the explicit path to the ffmpeg driver on my computer.  Your path will be different.  But in either case, Python now knows where to point to for ffmpeg so that it can use FFMpegWriter to create mp4 movie files."
