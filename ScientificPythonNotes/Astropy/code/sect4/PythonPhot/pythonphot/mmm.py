    """Estimate the sky background in a stellar contaminated field.

    MMM assumes that contaminated sky pixel values overwhelmingly display 
    POSITIVE departures from the true value.  Adapted from DAOPHOT 
    routine of the same name.
    
    CALLING SEQUENCE:
         skymod,sigma,skew = mmm.mmm( sky, highbad= , readnoise=, debug=, 
                                      minsky=, nsky=, integer=)
    
    INPUTS:
         sky - Array or Vector containing sky values.  This version of
                MMM does not require SKY to be sorted beforehand.
    
    RETURNS:
         skymod - Scalar giving estimated mode of the sky values
         sigma -  Scalar giving standard deviation of the peak in the sky
                   histogram.  If for some reason it is impossible to derive
                   skymod, then SIGMA = -1.0
         skew -   Scalar giving skewness of the peak in the sky histogram
    
         If no output variables are supplied or if "debug" is set
         then the values of skymod, sigma and skew will be printed.
    
    OPTIONAL KEYWORD INPUTS:
         highbad - scalar value of the (lowest) "bad" pixel level (e.g. cosmic 
                    rays or saturated pixels) If not supplied, then there is 
                    assumed to be no high bad pixels.
         minsky - Integer giving mininum number of sky values to be used.   MMM
                    will return an error if fewer sky elements are supplied.
                    Default = 20.
         maxiter - integer giving maximum number of iterations allowed,default=50
         readnoise - Scalar giving the read noise (or minimum noise for any 
                     pixel).  Normally, MMM determines the (robust) median by 
                    averaging the central 20% of the sky values.  In some cases
                    where the noise is low, and pixel values are quantized a
                    larger fraction may be needed.  By supplying the optional
                    read noise parameter, MMM is better able to adjust the
                    fraction of pixels used to determine the median.                
         integer - Set this keyword if the  input SKY vector only contains
                    discrete integer values.  This keyword is only needed if the
                    SKY vector is of type float or double precision, but contains 
                    only discrete integer values.  (Prior to July 2004, the
                    equivalent of /INTEGER was set for all data types)
         debug -   If this keyword is set and non-zero, then additional 
                    information is displayed at the terminal.

    OPTIONAL OUTPUT KEYWORD:
         nsky - Integer scalar giving the number of pixels actually used for the
                 sky computation (after outliers have been removed).

    NOTES:
         (1) Program assumes that low "bad" pixels (e.g. bad CCD columns) have
              already been deleted from the SKY vector.
         (2) MMM was updated in June 2004 to better match more recent versions
              of DAOPHOT.
         (3) Does not work well in the limit of low Poisson integer counts
         (4) MMM may fail for strongly skewed distributions.

    METHOD:
         The algorithm used by MMM consists of roughly two parts:
           (1) The average and sigma of the sky pixels is computed.  These values
                are used to eliminate outliers, i.e. values with a low probability
                given a Gaussian with specified average and sigma.  The average
                and sigma are then recomputed and the process repeated up to 20
                iterations.
           (2) The amount of contamination by stars is estimated by comparing the 
                mean and median of the remaining sky pixels.  If the mean is larger
                than the median then the true sky value is estimated by
                3*median - 2*mean
