    "When your posterior is multi-modal or otherwise hard to sample with a standard MCMC, a good option to try is parallel-tempered MCMC (PTMCMC). PTMCMC runs multiple MCMCâ€™s at different temperatures, T. Each MCMC samples from a modified posterior, given by\n",

    "\n",
    "As T goes to infinity the posterior becomes the prior. If the likelihood is a Gaussian with standard deviation $\\sigma$, then the tempered likelihood is proportional to a Gaussian with standard deviation $\\sigma$$\\sqrt{T}$.   Periodically during the run, the different temperatures swap members of their ensemble in a way that preserves detailed balance. The hot chains can more easily explore parameter space because the likelihood is flatter and broader, while the cold chains do a good job of exploring the peaks of the likelihood. This can dramatically improve convergence if your likelihood function has many well-separated modes.\n",
