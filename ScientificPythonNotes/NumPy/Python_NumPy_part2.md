## Section 2: Array Arithmetic and Universal Functions

### Arithmetic

As stated in the previous section, arrays are important because they enable you to express batch operations on datawithout writing any for loops. I.e. they allow for _vectorization_ which will almost always be faster than looping.    Any arithmetic operations between equal-size arrays applies the operation element-wise.

Beyond the simple example given before, here are some examples of array arithmetic:

```
arr = np.array([[1., 2., 3.], [4., 5., 6.]])

arr

#array([[ 1., 2., 3.],#[ 4., 5., 6.]])

arr * arr

#array([[ 1., 4., 9.],#[ 16., 25., 36.]])

arr - arr
#array([[ 0., 0., 0.],#[ 0., 0., 0.]])
```

Arithmetic operations with scalars propagate the scalar argument to each element inthe array:

```
1 / arr

#array([[ 1. , 0.5 , 0.3333],#[ 0.25 , 0.2 , 0.1667]])

arr ** 0.5

#array([[ 1. , 1.4142, 1.7321],#[ 2. , 2.2361, 2.4495]])
```

Comparisons between arrays of the same size yield boolean arrays:

```
arr2 = np.array([[0., 4., 1.], [7., 2., 12.]])
arr2

arr2 > arr
#array([[False, True, False],#[ True, False, True]], dtype=bool)

```

Operations between arrays of different sizes is called _broadcasting_: we will discuss that later.

### Universal and Other Key Functions

First, there are _aggregate_ functions that perform an operation on a set of values and produce a single result.   Generally, these are self-explanatory but we give details below.

They are called by ``np.[functionname]``.  e.g. if an array is ``np.array([3,4,5,6])`` then we can compute the mean value by``np.mean(a)``.

| Function| Description |
| -------| ----------- | 
|sum|	Returns the sum of array elements over a given axis.
|prod|	Returns the product of array elements over a given axis.
|mean|	Computes the arithmetic mean along the specified axis.
|median|	Computes the median along the specified axis.
|std|	Computes the standard deviation along the specified axis.
|var|	Computes the variance along the specified axis.
|min|	Returns the indices of the minimum values along an axis.
|max|	Returns the indices of the maximum values along an axis.
|all|	Checks if all array elements along a given axis evaluate to True.
|any|	Checks if any array element along a given axis evaluates to True.
|cumsum|	Returns the cumulative sum of the elements along a given axis.
|cumprod|	Returns the cumulative product of the elements along a given axis.

NumPy contains _universal functions_ that perform vectorized operations on NumPy arrays. 

_unary_ universal functions perform element-wise transformations and are called as ``np.functionname(array)``.  E.g. ``np.exp(array)``, ``np.sqrt(array)``, ``np.floor(array)``.   Here are some examples:

| Function| Description |
| -------| ----------- | 
|abs, fabs | Compute the absolute value element-wise for integer, floating-point, or complex values|sqrt |Compute the square root of each element (equivalent to arr ** 0.5)|square |Compute the square of each element (equivalent to arr ** 2)|exp |Compute the exponent ex of each element|log, log10,log2, log1p |Natural logarithm (base e), log base 10, log base 2, and log(1 + x), respectively|sign |Compute the sign of each element: 1 (positive), 0 (zero), or â€“1 (negative)|ceil |Compute the ceiling of each element (i.e., smallest integer greater than or equal to that number)|floor | Compute the floor of each element (i.e., the largest integer less than or equal to each element)|rint |Round elements to the nearest integer, preserving the dtype|modf |Return fractional and integral parts of array as a separate array|isnan |Return boolean array indicating whether each value is NaN (Not a Number)|isfinite, isinf |Return boolean array indicating whether whether each element is finite (non-inf, non-NaN) or infinite,respectively|cos, cosh, sin,sinh, tan, tanh |Regular and hyperbolic trigonometric functions|arccos, arccosh,arcsin, arcsinh,arctan, arctanh | Inverse trigonometric functions|logical_not | Compute truth value of not x element-wise (equivalent to ~arr).

_binary_ universal functions two two arrays and return a single array as a result.  They are called as ``np.functionname(array1,array2)``.  Here are some examples:

| Function| Description |
| -------| ----------- | 
|add |Add corresponding elements in arrays|subtract |Subtract elements in second array from first array|multiply| Multiply array elements|divide, floor_divide |Divide or floor divide (truncating the remainder)|power |Raise elements in first array to powers indicated in second array|maximum, fmax |Element-wise maximum; fmax ignores NaN|minimum, fmin |Element-wise minimum; fmin ignores NaN|mod |Element-wise modulus (remainder of division)|copysign |Copy sign of values in second argument to values in first argument
|greater, greater\_equal,less, less\_equal,equal, not_equal|Perform element-wise comparison, yielding boolean array (equivalent to infix operators >, >=, <, <=, ==, !=)|logical\_and,logical\_or, logical\_xor|Compute element-wise truth value of logical operation (equivalent to infix operators & |, ^)

Some ufuncs can return multiple arrays -- e.g. ``np.modf`` which returns the fractional and integral parts of a floating point array.   But these are uncommon.
